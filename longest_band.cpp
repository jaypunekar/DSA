/*
Given an array containing N integers, find the length of the longest band.

A band is defined as the longest subsequence which can be reordered in such a manner that all
elements appear consicutive (i.e. with absolute difference of 1 between neighbouring elements)

Input
[1, 9, 3, 0, 18, 5, 2, 4, 10, 7, 6]

Output
[8]

Explaination
Largest subsequence containing consecutive numbers is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
